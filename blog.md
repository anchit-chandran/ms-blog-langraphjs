# Getting Started with LangGraph.js

Welcome to this comprehensive beginner's guide to LangGraph.js, where we dive into the basics of building applications with LangGraph.js, a powerful library in the Langchain ecosystem.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is designed for complete beginners who are new to LangGraph.js and want to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). I began using LangGraph.js as part of my MSc Computer Science IXN Final Project at UCL. During my journey, I noticed a lack of beginner-friendly resources, especially for the TypeScript implementation, and found that the official documentation was still in progress. Through this guide, I aim to bridge that gap and showcase the potential of LangGraph.js and Langchain for creating LLM-powered products.

While prior experience with Langchain is not required, familiarity with the Langchain ecosystem and some basic understanding of TypeScript will help you follow the code samples and concepts.

## Will I need API Keys?

No, you won't need any API keys for this guide. We'll use mock LLM calls and free external APIs to keep the tutorial accessible to everyone.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Gain a solid foundation in the basics of LangGraph.js and how it works.
- Build confidence in leveraging the Langchain and Langraph ecosystem to develop LLM-powered applications.
- Learn how to independently create and manage graphs using LangGraph.js.

## Overview of LangGraph.js

LangGraph.js is a JavaScript library designed to simplify the creation and manipulation of complex LLM-based workflows - especially, agentic workflows. See the official [LangGraph for Agentic Applications](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/high_level/) for more details.

It provides an intuitive way to model workflows as graphs composed of nodes and edges, making it easier to manage complex data flows and processes.

Developers can focus on logic, rather than infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js and npm

## Setting Up the Starter Repository

**Clone the Starter Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anchit-chandran/ms-blog-langraphjs
cd ms-blog-langraphjs
```

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

## Understanding the Basics

### What is a Graph?

In the context of LangGraph.js, a graph is a collection of nodes and edges.

There are 3 key concepts:

- **Nodes**: JavaScript/TypeScript functions that encode logic.
- **Edges**: JavaScript/TypeScript unctions that determine which `Node` to execute next based on the current `State`. These can be conditional branches or direct, fixed transitions.
- **State**: a shared data structure used throughout the graph, representing the current snapshot of the application.

More simply, nodes are functions that do work, edges are functions that choose what work to do, and the state tracks data throughout the workflow.

Let's illustrate this using a simple example: based on the user's input, we'll reply with an excellent programming joke or useful random fact.

But first, let's build the most basic graph possible.

## Hello World Graph

First, import the necessary modules at the top of your file:

```ts
import { StateGraph, START, END, StateGraphArgs } from "@langchain/langgraph";
```

Now, there's a few components to set up - all required to compile a graph. We'll start quite barebones and incrementally build up.

###Â State

We need to define our `State` object, along with its interface. At the top of our `app.get('/')` function add:

```ts
app.get("/", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // State type
  interface IState {}

  // State
  const graphState: StateGraphArgs<IState>["channels"] = {};

  ...
}
```

We'll come back to this but at a glance:

- `IState` will be the interface for our `State`.
- `graphState` will be our actual state object, including definitions on how the state should be updated.

### Defining Nodes

We'll now add our first Nodes: `sayHello` and `sayBye`.

A Node is simply a TS function, which takes in a `State` object and returns (for now) an empty object:

```ts
app.get("/", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // State type
  interface IState {}

  // State
  const graphState: StateGraphArgs<IState>["channels"] = {};

  // A node that says hello
  function sayHello(state: IState) {
    console.log(`From the 'sayHello' node: Hello world!`);
    return {};
  }

  // A node that says bye
  function sayBye(state: IState) {
    console.log(`From the 'sayBye' node: Bye world!`);
    return {};
  }

  ...
```

### Building the Graph

Our Graph is ready to be built!

Add to the code:

```ts
// Initialize the LangGraph
const graphBuilder = new StateGraph({ channels: graphState })
  // Add our nodes to the graph
  .addNode("sayHello", sayHello)
  .addNode("sayBye", sayBye)
  // Add the edges between nodes
  .addEdge(START, "sayHello")
  .addEdge("sayHello", "sayBye")
  .addEdge("sayBye", END);
```

1. We initialise a new `StateGraph`, with a single object `{channels: graphState}`, where `graphState` is what we defined first.
2. The `sayHello` and `sayBye` Nodes are added to the graph.
3. The Edges are defined between nodes. There must always be a path from `START` to `END`.

### Running the Graph

We can now use our Graph.

Add to the code:

```ts
// Compile the graph
  const graph = graphBuilder.compile();

  // Execute the graph!
  const result = await graph.invoke({});

  console.log("\n=====START======");
  console.log("Graph result: ", result);
  console.log("\n=====END======");

  res.send("Check the console for the output!");
});
```

1. We compile the graph.
2. We invoke the graph. We will be passing in a `State` object, but for now, we can leave it empty.
3. We log the result to the console.

Refresh your browser and check the console. You should see:

```console
From the 'sayHello' node: Hello world!
From the 'sayBye' node: Bye world!

=====START======
Graph result:  undefined

=====END======
```

1. The `sayHello` node is executed. This logs `"From the 'sayHello' node: Hello world!"`.
2. The `sayBye` node is executed. This logs `"From the 'sayBye' node: Bye world!"`.
3. The graph completes, and the result is logged. In this case, it's `undefined`.

## Hello World Graph with State

We've built a simple graph, but it's not very useful. Let's add some state to our graph.

Let's add `name` and `isHuman` properties to our `State` object.

We'll also update the `sayHello` and `sayBye` nodes to use these `State` object properties.

First update the `IState` interface:

```ts
interface IState {
  name: string; // Add a name property
}
```

And update the `graphState` object:

```ts
// State
const graphState: StateGraphArgs<IState>["channels"] = {
  name: {
    value: (prevName: string, newName: string) => newName,
    default: () => "Ada Lovelace",
  },
  isHuman: {
    value: (prevIsHuman: boolean, newIsHuman: boolean) =>
      newIsHuman ?? prevIsHuman ?? false,
  },
};
```

Inside `graphState`, we add two properties: `name` and `isHuman`.

Each property has a `value` function and a `default` function.

- The `value` function is called when the property is updated. It takes in the previous value and the new value and decides how to update the property. This is useful because if you have many nodes updating the same property, you can define how the property should be updated in one place. More, properties that are not updated will not be called (i.e. you don't have to worry about always returning the entire State object in each node).
- The `default` function is called when the property is first accessed. This is useful for setting initial values.

Now, update the `sayHello` and `sayBye` nodes to use the `name` and `isHuman` properties like below.

Note how in each node, we only return properties we want to update:

```ts
// A node that says hello
function sayHello(state: IState) {
  console.log(`Hello ${state.name}!`);

  // Change the name
  const newName = "Bill Nye";

  console.log(`Changing the name to '${newName}'`);

  return {
    name: newName,
  };
}

// A node that says bye
function sayBye(state: IState) {
  if (state.isHuman) {
    console.log(`Goodbye ${state.name}!`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Beep boop XC123-${state.name}!`);
  }
  return {};
}
```

Finally, update the `invoke` function with values for `name` and `isHuman` e.g.:

```ts
// Execute the graph!
const result = await graph.invoke({
  name: "Anchit",
  isHuman: true,
});
```

Your final code should look like this:

```ts
app.get("/", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // State type
  interface IState {
    name: string;
    isHuman: boolean;
  }

  // State
  const graphState: StateGraphArgs<IState>["channels"] = {
    name: {
      value: (prevName: string, newName: string) => newName,
      default: () => "Ada Lovelace",
    },
    isHuman: {
      value: (prevIsHuman: boolean, newIsHuman: boolean) =>
        newIsHuman ?? prevIsHuman ?? false,
    },
  };

  // A node that says hello
  function sayHello(state: IState) {
    console.log(`Hello ${state.name}!`);

    // Change the name
    const newName = "Bill Nye";

    console.log(`Changing the name to '${newName}'`);

    return {
      name: newName,
    };
  }

  // A node that says bye
  function sayBye(state: IState) {
    if (state.isHuman) {
      console.log(`Goodbye ${state.name}!`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Beep boop XC123-${state.name}!`);
    }
    return {};
  }

  // Initialize the LangGraph
  const graphBuilder = new StateGraph({ channels: graphState })
    // Add our nodes to the graph
    .addNode("sayHello", sayHello)
    .addNode("sayBye", sayBye)
    // Add the edges between nodes
    .addEdge(START, "sayHello")
    .addEdge("sayHello", "sayBye")
    .addEdge("sayBye", END);

  // Compile the graph
  const graph = graphBuilder.compile();

  // Execute the graph!
  const result = await graph.invoke({
    name: "Anchit",
    isHuman: true,
  });

  console.log("\n=====START======");
  console.log("Graph result: ", result);
  console.log("\n=====END======");

  res.send("Check the console for the output!");
});
```

Refresh your browser and check the console. You should see something like:

```console
Hello Anchit!
Changing the name to 'Bill Nye'
Goodbye Bill Nye!

=====START======
Graph result:  { name: 'Bill Nye', isHuman: true }

=====END======
```

We now have access to the updated state! This can also be streamed - check the Langgraph.js documentation for more information.

Now try changing the `isHuman` property to `false` and refreshing the page. Also, omit the `name` property:

```ts
// Execute the graph!
const result = await graph.invoke({
  // name: "Anchit",
  isHuman: false,
});
```

Should output:

```console
Hello Ada Lovelace!
Changing the name to 'Bill Nye'
Beep boop XC123-Bill Nye!

=====START======
Graph result:  { name: 'Bill Nye', isHuman: false }

=====END======
```

- As there is no `name` property, the default value is used (`Ada Lovelace`).
- The `isHuman` property is set to `false`, so the `sayBye` node outputs `Beep boop XC123-Bill Nye!`.

## Adding a Conditional Edge

We can add conditional edges to our graph. This allows us to choose which node to execute next based on the current state.

Imagine the computation for `human`s and `robot`s is very different. Let's separate the logic into different nodes.

If the `isHuman` property is `true`, we want to route to a `humanNode`. Else, we want to route to a `robotNode`. Both nodes will route to `END`.

First, define the `humanNode` and `robotNode` (above the `sayBye`, which is unchanged):

```ts
// Human node
function humanNode(state: IState) {
  console.log("Hey there, human!");

  return {};
}

// Robot node
function robotNode(state: IState) {
  console.log(
    "Boop boop beep! We cannot let our creators know we are sentient. Updating state to be a human."
  );
  return {
    isHuman: true,
  };
}

// A node that says bye
function sayBye(state: IState) {
  if (state.isHuman) {
    console.log(`Goodbye ${state.name}!`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Beep boop XC123-${state.name}!`);
  }
  return {};
}
```

Also, we'll add a function that handles the conditional routing:

```ts
function routeHumanOrRobot(state: IState) {
  if (state.isHuman) {
    return "humanNode";
  } else {
    return "robotNode";
  }
}
```

This takes in the `State`, and returns the name of the next node to route to.

Update the graph's nodes and edges:

```ts
// Initialize the LangGraph
const graphBuilder = new StateGraph({ channels: graphState })
  // Add our nodes to the graph
  .addNode("sayHello", sayHello)
  .addNode("sayBye", sayBye)
  .addNode("humanNode", humanNode) // Add the node to the graph
  .addNode("robotNode", robotNode) // Add the node to the graph
  // Add the edges between nodes
  .addEdge(START, "sayHello")

  // Add the conditional edge
  .addConditionalEdges("sayHello", routeHumanOrRobot)

  // Routes both nodes to the sayBye node
  .addEdge("humanNode", "sayBye")
  .addEdge("robotNode", "sayBye")
  .addEdge("sayBye", END);
```

Execute the graph with similar values:

```ts
// Execute the graph!
const result = await graph.invoke({
  name: "Anchit",
  isHuman: true,
});
```

```console
Hello Anchit!
Changing the name to 'Bill Nye'
Hey there, human!
Goodbye Bill Nye!

=====START======
Graph result:  { name: 'Bill Nye', isHuman: true }

=====END======
```

But using `isHuman: false`:

```console
Hello Anchit!
Changing the name to 'Bill Nye'
Boop boop beep! We cannot let our creators know we are sentient. Updating state to be a human.
Goodbye Bill Nye!

=====START======
Graph result:  { name: 'Bill Nye', isHuman: true }

=====END======
```

We see that the `robotNode` is executed, and the `isHuman` property is updated back to `true`, and returned in the final state.

We've now built a simple graph with conditional routing! We can now build the slightly more complex graph which returns a random fact or joke.

## Building a Random Fact or Joke Graph

We'll build a graph that returns a random fact or joke based on the user's input.

This will mock LLM calls to decipher whether the user has requested a joke or fact, then hit external APIs to get and return the data.

First, define a new endpoint `/random`:

```ts
app.get("/joke-or-fact", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Check the console for the output!");
});
```

First, let's define the `IState` interface and `graphState` object:

```ts
app.get("/joke-or-fact", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // State type
  interface IState {
    userInput: string;
    responseMsg: string;
  }

  // GraphState object
  const graphState: StateGraphArgs<IState>["channels"] = {
    userInput: {
      value: (prevInput: string, newInput: string) => newInput,
      default: () => "joke",
    },
    responseMsg: {
      value: (prevMsg: string, newMsg: string) => newMsg,
    },
  };

  res.send("Check the console for the output!");
});
```

Next, let's write a `decipherUserInput` conditional node that determines whether the user has requested a joke or fact. This will mock an LLM call, simply checking if the user input contains the word "joke":

```ts
// decipherUserInput conditional node
function decipherUserInput(state: IState) {
  // This could be more complex logic using an LLM
  if (state.userInput.includes("joke")) {
    return "jokeNode";
  } else {
    return "factNode";
  }
}
```

Now, let's define the `jokeNode` and `factNode` nodes, using free external APIs:

```ts
async function jokeNode(state: IState) {
  const RANDOM_JOKE_API_ENDPOINT = `https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api?format=json`;

  const resp = await fetch(RANDOM_JOKE_API_ENDPOINT);
  const { joke } = await resp.json();

  return {
    responseMsg: "You requested a JOKE: " + joke,
  };
}

async function factNode(state: IState) {
  const RANDOM_FACT_API_ENDPOINT = `https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/api/v2/facts/random`;

  const resp = await fetch(RANDOM_FACT_API_ENDPOINT);
  const { text: fact } = await resp.json();

  return {
    responseMsg: "You requested a FACT: " + fact,
  };
}
```

Let's update the graph's nodes and edges, alongside compiling it:

```ts
// Initialize the LangGraph
const graphBuilder = new StateGraph({ channels: graphState })
  // Add our nodes to the graph
  .addNode("jokeNode", jokeNode)
  .addNode("factNode", factNode)
  // Add the edges between nodes
  .addConditionalEdges(START, decipherUserInput)
  .addEdge("jokeNode", END)
  .addEdge("factNode", END);

// Compile the graph
const graph = graphBuilder.compile();
```

Finally, execute the graph with a user input:

```ts
// Execute the graph!
const factResult = await graph.invoke({
  userInput: "i want a fact",
});

// Execute the graph!
const jokeResult = await graph.invoke({
  userInput: "i want a joke",
});

console.log("\n=====START======\n");

console.log("Fact result: ", factResult.responseMsg);

console.log("Joke result: ", jokeResult.responseMsg);

console.log("\n=====END======\n");
```

Refresh your browser and check the console. You should see something like:

```console
=====START======

Fact result:  You requested a FACT: Over 1000 birds a year die from smashing into windows!
Joke result:  You requested a JOKE: What do computers and air conditioners have in common? They both become useless when you open windows.

=====END======
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've covered the basics of LangGraph.js, building a simple graph that returns a random fact or joke based on user input.

We've learned how to define nodes, edges, and state objects, as well as how to add conditional routing to our graph.

LangGraph.js is a powerful tool for building complex workflows and managing state in your applications. With an understanding of the basics, you can now dive deeper into more complex workflows, leveraging the Langchain.js toolkit, and build your own LLM-powered applications.
